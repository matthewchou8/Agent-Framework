# 📋 Comprehensive Execution Plan

## Phase 1: Content Analysis & Architecture Design ✅

### 1.1 Framework Understanding ✅

**Analysis Complete** - I have identified:

**Core Components:**
- **3 Primary Client Types**: Assistants, Chat, Responses (each with OpenAI/Azure variants)
- **ChatAgent Abstraction**: High-level agent interface with lifecycle management
- **Thread Management**: Stateful conversation handling with service-managed and local storage
- **Tool Integration**: Function tools, hosted tools (code interpreter, file search, web search), MCP tools

**Key Patterns:**
- Context manager pattern for resource cleanup
- Streaming vs non-streaming responses
- Agent-level vs run-level tool configuration
- Thread persistence strategies (in-memory, service-managed, thread ID-based)
- Approval workflows for hosted MCP tools

### 1.2 Agent Type Selection & Definition ✅

I have selected **5 distinct agent types** that showcase the framework's breadth:

| # | Agent Type | Primary Use Case | Key Capabilities |
|---|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Basic Conversational Agent** | Customer service, Q&A, general chat | Function calling, streaming responses, basic thread management |
| 2 | **RAG Agent (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | Knowledge base queries, document search | File upload, vector store management, knowledge retrieval |
| 3 | **Code Execution Agent** | Data analysis, calculations, automation | Code interpreter, dynamic Python execution, computational tasks |
| 4 | **Multi-Modal Agent** | Visual analysis, current events, complex reasoning | Image analysis, web search, reasoning capabilities |
| 5 | **MCP-Integrated Agent** | External tool access, enterprise integration | Local/hosted MCP servers, approval workflows, enterprise connectors |
